README for Neural Network

This README provides guidance on how to use and understand the R scripts which is focused on implementing and evaluating neural network models for data analysis.

Overview
The script is designed to apply neural network techniques to a dataset. Neural networks are a subset of machine learning that are particularly good at identifying patterns in complex data sets.

Key Features
Neural Network Implementation: The script likely includes the creation and training of neural network models using R libraries.
Data Preprocessing: There may be steps to prepare the dataset for neural network analysis, such as normalization or handling missing values.
Model Evaluation: The script probably includes methods to assess the performance of the neural network, such as calculating accuracy or loss metrics.
Visualization: Visualization tools might be used to illustrate the performance or characteristics of the neural network.

Usage
Data Preparation: Make sure your data is in a suitable format (e.g., CSV) and has the necessary features for neural network modeling.
Run the Script: Execute the script in an R environment. It will apply neural network techniques to your data.
Result Analysis: Carefully review the outputs, including any performance metrics or visualizations, to understand the effectiveness of the neural network model.

Requirements
R Environment: The script should be run in an R environment. RStudio is a recommended IDE for ease of use.
Library Dependencies: Ensure that all necessary R libraries are installed. This might include libraries like `neuralnet`, `keras`, `tidyverse`, etc.
Data Format: Your data should be in a format that the script expects, typically a CSV file with specific columns. Adjust the script if your data structure differs.

Customization
Script Adjustments: Depending on your specific dataset, you may need to modify the script, especially the data loading and preprocessing sections.
Model Parameters: You might want to tune the parameters of the neural network model for better performance on your dataset.
