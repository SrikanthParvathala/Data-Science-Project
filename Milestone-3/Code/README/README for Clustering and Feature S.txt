README for Clustering and Feature Selection in R

This README covers two R scripts: one for clustering analysis (`Q3_code-Clustering.R`) and another for feature selection (`Q5_code-Feature_Selection.R`). These scripts demonstrate advanced data analysis techniques using R programming.

1. Clustering Analysis (`Q3_code-Clustering.R`)

Overview
The script performs clustering analysis on a dataset. Clustering is a method of unsupervised learning used to group data into clusters based on similarity.

Key Features
Data Preprocessing: The script may include steps for cleaning and preparing the data for clustering.
Clustering Algorithms: Implements one or more clustering techniques like K-means, hierarchical clustering, or DBSCAN.
Visualization: The script likely visualizes clusters for better understanding and interpretation.
Evaluation: There might be methods to evaluate the quality of the clustering, like silhouette scores.

Usage
Load your dataset into R, making sure it's compatible with the clustering techniques used in the script.
Run the script to perform clustering analysis.
Interpret the results, paying close attention to the visualization and evaluation metrics.

2. Feature Selection (`Q5_code-Feature_Selection.R`)

Overview
This script focuses on feature selection, which is crucial in machine learning to identify the most relevant features for modeling.

Key Features
Data Preparation: The script likely includes data preprocessing steps suitable for feature selection.
Feature Selection Techniques: May implement methods like recursive feature elimination, principal component analysis, or other statistical approaches.
Model Integration: The selected features might be used to train a machine learning model, demonstrating the impact of feature selection.

Usage
Prepare your dataset, ensuring it's suitable for the feature selection methods implemented.
Run the script to perform feature selection.
Use the selected features for further modeling and analysis.

General Instructions
Data Format: Ensure your data is in a format compatible with R (like CSV) and matches the expected format of the scripts.
Library Dependencies: Install any required R packages before running the scripts. Common packages might include `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, `caret`, `cluster`, etc.
Customization: You may need to adjust the scripts slightly to fit your specific dataset, especially column names and data types.
